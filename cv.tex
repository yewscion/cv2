  & \parbox{0.8\textwidth}{I covered changing roles on the overnight sort
    shift including shift planning, monitoring and managing associate
    performance, and quality assurance. In Spring 2020, I took ownership of
    COVID-19 rollouts including training associates in temperature screening
    procedures, adjusting the building layout to meet social distancing
    guidelines, and consistently working with others to ensure up to date
    signage was posted site-wide. In September 2020, I transferred buildings
    to assist with the launch of the region’s newest delivery station. I
    started on the load out shift: my responsibilities included ensuring
    routes were scheduled for the correct times and monitoring route
    progress. In addition to my previous COVID-19 responsibilities, I handled
    preparing and overseeing testing—including the shipment of completed
    tests. In July 2021, I began overseeing the overnight shift in addition
    to the load out shift, where my responsibilities reflected a combination
    of both shifts.}
